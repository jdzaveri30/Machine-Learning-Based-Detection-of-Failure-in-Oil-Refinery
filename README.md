Data-driven failure analysis of distillation column 


The distribution control systems in the crude oil refinery produce volumes of datasets on a daily basis to monitor the operation. The plant operating decisions are made based on how the engineers and operators are managing and scaling the volumes of data. Data collected in the distillation column are large, complex, and unpredictable than the other equipment at the refinery. Fast-growing databases and the development of data controllers can help to create diagnostic tools to assess column failure. Herein, we propose a resilience engineering framework comprised of machine learning (ML) and the Functional resonance analysis method (FRAM). Two facets of the proposed framework include the development of an algorithm for Lagrangian SVM (LSVM), Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the use of a FRAM-hexagonal operator for the dataset. The former requires mathematical coding to detect the failure events, and the latter uses an operator to prevent the failure based on the data domain. The proposed framework detects the failure events of the column, such as over-pressurization and flooding. The datasets such as pressure, temperature, and reflux obtained from a refinery are trained, tested, and validated using these ML models. The ratio used for training and the testing dataset is 80:20. The RF model shows 99.8% accuracy with the validation dataset. The response set from the LSVM model is fed to a FRAM hexagon, and the failure points in the column are identified based on the counts and recounts of the resonance events.
